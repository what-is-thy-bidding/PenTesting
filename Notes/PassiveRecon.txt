5 phases of Hacking

1 Reconnaissance: Information Gathering.
	Passive and Active
	
	Passive doesn't require client interaction.
	Looking up linkedin or google information, twitter, facebook	
	No scanning on the server or against the host etc.

	Acitve is more of a phase 2. 
	
2 Scanning and Enumeration
	Nmap, Nessus, Nikto etc 
	Metaspoilt can do scanning.
	Openvas is a scanner.

3 Gaining Access
	Exploits, social engineering

4. Maintaining Access

5. Covering Tracks
	ps exec an auto tool to cover tracks
	smp credentials to get a shell


Passive Recon - Physical/Social

	Location Information
		Satellite images
		Drone Recon
		Building layout(badge reader, break areas,security 
				fencing)
	
	Job Information
		Employees (name, job, title, phone number, manager)
		Pictures(badge photos,desk photos, computer photos etc.)

	
	Web/Host
	
	Target Validation - WHOIS, nslookup,dnsrecon
	Finding Subdomains - Google Fu, dig, Nmap,Sublist3r,crt.sh etc
	FingerPrinting- Nmap, Wappalyzer, WhatWeb, BuiltWith, Netcat
	Data Breachers -  HaveIBeenPwned and similar lists


OSINT tools
If you want to create an account: https://hunter.io
It will search through with an email address. (tesla.com)
1.4 billion clear text passwords github- google search it!

Bugcrowd Tesla

theharvester- cmd line
It is going to want an API key.

	theharvester -d tesla.com -l 500 -b google

domain name = tesla,500 searches per page, from google.

haveibeenpwned = search all the tesla address.

Bluto = looks through haveibeenpwned info, does active recon, zone
	transfer, bruteforce. 
	check out the github page for more info.

	pip install bluto

if there is an error while installing bluto

gedit /usr/local/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/Bluto/modules/date_min.py

replace other import with olefile with:

	import olefile

crt.sh =  find subdomains
	%.tesla.com

Fingerprinting : wapplyzer
	download and install
	
	tesla.com
	install on firefox and it tells you all the software info
	Jquery, Javascrip, AWS etc.

FingerPrinting : whatweb -V tesla.com 
		kind of active recon, scanning
		Look at old bugbounty reports, what kind of 
		vulnerabilites they had in the past, what is their
		infrastructure.
		Scanning without using your IP.

Fingerprinting : builtwith.com
